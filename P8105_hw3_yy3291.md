From an initial summarizing look at the data instacart there are
1,384,617 observations of 15 variables with 4 variables that are
categorical and 11 that are numerical. There also seems to be one binary
variable, reordered, that corresponds to if an item is ordered again or
not. Ther variables order day of the week and order hour of the day are
interesting and show a median of 3 for day of the week meaning Wednesday
is a day clients most often place their orders and with a median of 14
for hour of the day it seems most orders are places at 2 pm.

# Problem 1 cont.-how many aisles are there and which aisles are the most items ordered from

``` r
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ℹ 124 more rows

``` r
instacart1_df =
instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  group_by(aisle_id, aisle) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs = n())
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle_id'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

We can see from the subsetted data frame that there are 134 aisles and
using the toggle arrows when viewing the instacart1_df we can see that
some of the aisles where most items are ordered from are the fresh
vegetables, fresh fruits, packaged vegetables fruits, yoghurt and
packaged cheese aisles.

# Making a plot with number of items ordered in each aisle, filtering to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered

  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = aisle)) + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(
    aisle_id = as.factor(aisle),
    aisle_id = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
  )
```

    ## # A tibble: 0 × 3
    ## # Groups:   aisle_id [0]
    ## # ℹ 3 variables: aisle_id <fct>, aisle <chr>, n <int>

``` r
aisles_plot =

  ggplot(aes(x = aisle_id, y = n_obs)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Number of Items Ordered in Each Aisle", x = "Name of Aisles", y = "Number of Items Ordered")
```

# Making a table showing the most popular items in each of the aisles baking ingredients, dog food care, and packaged vegetables fruits including the number of times each is ordered

``` r
instacart |> 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) |>
  group_by(aisle) |> 
  count(product_name) |> 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) |> 
  filter(rank < 4) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

This creates a data frame where we can toggle through and see that in
the aisle baking ingredients the two most ordered items are Light Brown
Sugar which was ordered 157 times and Pure Baking Soda which was ordered
140 times; in the aisle dog food care the two most ordered items in dog
food care are Organix Grain Free Chicken & Vegetable Dog Food which was
ordered 14 times and Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe whcih was
ordered 13 times and lastly in packaged vegetables fruits the two most
ordered items are Organic Baby Spinach which was ordered 3324 times and
Organic Raspberries which was ordered 1920 times.

# Making a data frame showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week

``` r
mean_hour_df = 
  instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

From the data we can see that the mean hour of the day at which the
items Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered each day of the
week.

The aim for the final data frame is that all originally observed
variables are included; exclude participants less than 21 years of age,
and those with missing demographic data; and encode data with reasonable
variable classes (i.e. not numeric, and using factors with the ordering
of tables and plots in mind).

In the Less than high school educational category there is a peak of 40-50 years old for men and one around 70 years old for women. In the More than High School Educational Category it seems both mean and women have the same peak in the younger age groups between 20-30.Interestingly, the distributions for both sexes in the Less than High School category and the More than High School category are skewed concordantly whereas for the High School or Equivalent educational category the distributions are skewed oppositionaly with the Male distribution being almost left skewed and the female one being right skewed.
